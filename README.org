* keysmash
Adds some satisfying keyboard noises when you type stuff,
so you can brag to your friends about that fancy new mechanical keyboard you got.

** Run
#+begin_src shell
  nix shell github:42loco42/keysmash
  sudo keysmash
#+end_src

Note that keysmash has to be specifically run with =sudo=
so that it can attach to the user's pulseaudio/pipewire-pulse stack!
